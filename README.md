# pNoC--based-System-design-Techniques-Routing-Analysis-
The pNoCs is the new generation of Network-on-Chips and has been proposed as a novel solution for the communication infrastructure of chip multiprocessors as well as a different solution to eliminate limitations of Network-on-Chips. The analysis of two different routing are performed here.
