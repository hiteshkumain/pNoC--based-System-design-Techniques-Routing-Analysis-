The results for the optical link starts from the core (1 & 2) towards the core (4 & 1) in Mesh-based ONoC are as following:
Wavelength, Signal power (dBm), Incoherent crosstalk noise power (dBm), Coherent crosstalk (dBm), SNR (no coherent crosstalk)(dB), SNR (coherent crosstalk + incoherent crosstalk)(dB), SNR (signal power - coherent crosstalk)(dB)
1,-6.41368,-2.79399,-35.1661,-3.61969,-3.6222,-3.62548
