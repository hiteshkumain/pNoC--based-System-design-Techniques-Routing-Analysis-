The results for the optical link starts from the core (1 & 4) towards the core (2 & 3) in Mesh-based ONoC are as following:
Wavelength, Signal power (dBm), Incoherent crosstalk noise power (dBm), Coherent crosstalk (dBm), SNR (no coherent crosstalk)(dB), SNR (coherent crosstalk + incoherent crosstalk)(dB), SNR (signal power - coherent crosstalk)(dB)
1,-4.48619,-12.9,-35.6123,8.41377,8.39057,8.41041
