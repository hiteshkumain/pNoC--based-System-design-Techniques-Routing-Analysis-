Files Discription:
>>CommGenerator.cpp:
	This program file Takes M,N and max PKT size as input and generates a communication graph matrix [Randomly].
	The Communication Graph is a 2d adjancency matrix where the rows and column determines the cores and value 
	decide the packets to be transmitted.
		INPUT:- 
		>>M N          
		>>Packet Size
		OUTPUT Filename: CommGraph.txt

>>Config.txt
	This file contains the configurations of the NOC:
	>>Number of tasks 	: N_tasks
	>>Topology 		: [M] X [N]
	>>Mapping		: Each Core has some task associated with it done via mapping(Optimized).


>>generateTraceFile.cpp
	This file will randomly generate the trace file, which carries following information
	<t, Source, Destination, pkt>
	OUTPUT Filename : trace.txt


order of exe: 
1.	generateCommGraph.cpp -> CommGraph.txt
2.	generateTraceFile.cpp -> trace.txt
